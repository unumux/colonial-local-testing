# colonial-local-testing

Super early version of automated visual regression testing

## Usage
- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install`
- To run an initial "reference" test, run `npm run test:reference`
- Work as you normally would; make some changes to styling; etc
- Run a test with `npm run test` or just `npm test`
- A window should appear showing what has changed
- If the changes are what you expect them to be, run `npm run test:approve`
